<h2>Description</h2>
Cucumber and avocado sushi! 
<br>These rolls are easy to make and you can add either fake crab or smoked salmon. 
<br>Serve with teriyaki or soy sauce and wasabi!
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1¼ cups water</li>
<li>1 cup uncooked sushi rice</li>
<li>3 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
<li>1 pinch salt</li>
<li>4 sheets of nori (dried seaweed)</li>
<li>½ cucumber (sliced into thin strips)</li>
<li>1 avocado (peeled, pitted and sliced)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Combine the water and rice in a saucepan and bring to a boil. 
<br>Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes, or until rice is tender and water has been absorbed. 
<br>Remove from the heat and stir in the vinegar and a pinch of salt. 
<br>Set aside to cool.</li>
<li>Cover a bamboo sushi mat with plastic wrap to keep the rice from sticking. 
<br>Place a sheet of seaweed over the plastic. 
<br>Use your hands to spread the rice evenly onto the sheet, leaving about 1/2 inch of seaweed empty at the bottom.
<br>Arrange strips of cucumber and avocado across the center of the rice. 
<br>Lift the mat and roll over the vegetables once and press down. 
<br>Unroll, then roll again towards the exposed end of the seaweed sheet to make a long roll. 
<br>You may moisten with a little water to help seal. 
<br>Set aside and continue with remaining nori sheets, rice and fillings.</li>
<li>Use a sharp wet knife to slice the rolls into 5 or 6 slices. 
<br>Serve cut side up with your favorite sushi condiments.</li>
</ol>
