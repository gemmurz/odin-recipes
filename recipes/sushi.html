 </div>
<h2 class="headers">Ingredients</h2>
 <ul>
  <li class="ingredients">1¼ cups water</li>
  <li class="ingredients">1 cup uncooked sushi rice</li>
  <li class="ingredients">3 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
  <li class="ingredients">1 pinch salt</li>
  <li class="ingredients">4 sheets of nori (dried seaweed)</li>
  <li class="ingredients">½ cucumber (sliced into thin strips)</li>
  <li class="ingredients">1 avocado (peeled, pitted and sliced)</li>
 </ul>
<h2 class="headers">Steps</h2>
 <ol>
  <li class="steps">Combine the water and rice in a saucepan and bring to a boil. 
  <br>Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes, or until rice is tender and water has been absorbed. 
  <br>Remove from the heat and stir in the vinegar and a pinch of salt. 
  <br>Set aside to cool.</li>
  <li class="steps">Cover a bamboo sushi mat with plastic wrap to keep the rice from sticking. 
  <br>Place a sheet of seaweed over the plastic. 
  <br>Use your hands to spread the rice evenly onto the sheet, leaving about 1/2 inch of seaweed empty at the bottom.
  <br>Arrange strips of cucumber and avocado across the center of the rice. 
  <br>Lift the mat and roll over the vegetables once and press down. 
  <br>Unroll, then roll again towards the exposed end of the seaweed sheet to make a long roll. 
  <br>You may moisten with a little water to help seal. 
  <br>Set aside and continue with remaining nori sheets, rice and fillings.</li>
  <li class="steps">Use a sharp wet knife to slice the rolls into 5 or 6 slices. 
  <br>Serve cut side up with your favorite sushi condiments.</li>
